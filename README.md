Interactive visualization of historical price (currently only in EUR), health metrics, candlestick
and volume data for various cryptocurrencies. Data are obtained via API queries to Alpha Vantage.
The app is written in Julia and makes use of Dash.jl along with its react framework to generate a
dashboard style view accessible via a browser. Different moving averages are also calculated and
plotted along with the daily average price data. Averaging window can be selected by the user.

Functionality of the app will be extended in the future by adding more technical indicators.
**Contributions are most welcome!**

## How to use?

### API keys
- Free AlphaVantage API key can be obtained from [here.](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)
- Free demo key for CoinGecko API can be generated by following this [guide.](https://support.coingecko.com/hc/en-us/articles/21880397454233-User-Guide-How-to-sign-up-for-CoinGecko-Demo-API-and-generate-an-API-key)

### Running in Julia locally
This package is available via the General registry. Add it to your working Julia
environment by doing the following in the REPL:
* Press ']' to enter Pkg prompt

```julia
pkg> add CryptoDashApp
```

Once all the packages are downloaded, you can make use of the **CryptoDashApp**
module from the REPL itself or within a script by executing:

```julia
julia> ENV["KEY_AV"] = "your_AlphaVantage_key"
julia> ENV["KEY_CG"] = "your_CoinGecko_key"
julia> using CryptoDashApp
julia> run_app(8056) # where 8056 is the port
```

Now, open a new tab in your browser and check if you can access http://0.0.0.0:8056/ or http://127.0.0.1:8056/

### Running as a Docker container (for versions > 0.6.0)
Assuming that you have Docker installed, and have generated both API keys, a Docker image
can be created using the following steps:
* Clone this repository and cd to the directory

* Build the Docker image (Here `my_app` is the name of the generated image)
```bash
docker build --build-arg key_av="YOUR_KEY" --build-arg key_cg="YOUR_KEY" -t my_app .
```

* Once the image is successfully generated, start a container (port 8010 is hard-coded
in the Dockerfile, can also be changed if needed):
```bash
docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:8010:8010 my_app
```

* Check log output:
```bash
docker logs --follow <container id>
```

First plot will take a few seconds to appear, wait patiently! If you are running this app for the
first time, or on a different date, new data will be retrieved from Alpha Vantage, and then saved
to CSV files on disk. Keep in mind that the free API key imposes a limit of five calls/minute,
which means you won't be able to load data for more than five currencies in quick succession. In
case you see an error, wait for a while and then try again.
